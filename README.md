## Description
This is my ***first personal mobile UX/UI project***. Main goal is ***to visualize feelings and emotions through a journal calendar***.

## Research
I interviewed with my friends and families about their personal thoughts and experiences with journaling.

ðŸŸ¢ Main key points about journaling:
- People like to ponder and record about their personal feelings and emotions. (Main key) 
- People agree that questions about the feelings would be helpful for writing journals, but if they already have things to talk about then questions will be useless. (Make it optional) 
- People think that it is nice to look back at things â†’ which also gives me a sense that they might think journals are only for the future to look back on things?

ðŸ”´ Some problems that they face:
- Not many aesthetic journaling apps are available (boring same design format for writing)
- They cannot put different types of media format to journals
- Sometimes there are nothing to write about
- Typing on mobile is difficult

After the interviews, I tried out 3 different popular journaling apps such as Reflectly, Stoic and Prompted Journal.
My research concluded with possible features for my journaling app.

## Possible Features
- [x] Voice memo --> to resolve difficulty in typing on mobile phone
- [x] Feelings and emotion level
- [x] Calendar view
- [x] Adopting different media formats
- [ ] Various designs for journal template
- [ ] Journal look back reminder option (1 year before today etc.)
- [ ] Tag option
- [ ] (User can order printed journal book for the year)

## Wireframes
I used Figma for my Low/Hight fidelity wireframes. I sketched on my iPad first, and then got tested by people.
These are the testable mobile prototype.
