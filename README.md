## Description
This is my personal UX/UI project. Main goal is to visualize feelings and emotions through a journal calendar.

## Research
I interviewed with my friends and families about their personal thoughts and experiences with journaling.
Here is main key points about journaling:
- People like to ponder and record about their personal feelings and emotions. (Main key) 
- People agree that questions about the feelings would be helpful for writing journals, but if they already have things to talk about then questions will be useless. (Make it optional) 
- People think that it is nice to look back at things â†’ which also gives me a sense that they might think journals are only for the future to look back on things?

Here are some problems that they face:
- Not many aesthetic journaling apps are available (boring same design format for writing)
- They cannot put different types of media format to journals
- Sometimes there are nothing to write about
- Typing on mobile is difficult
